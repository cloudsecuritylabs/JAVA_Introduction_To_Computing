JAVA_Introduction_To_Computing
==============================

All codes written by Ankan Basu in Java Programming language for Introduction to Computer Science in JAVA.
Most of the files are uploaded as a jar file.

I recommend using BlueJ to run the codes. 

I had excellent time with the course that tought many introductory concepts in programming.

I have several functions that can be used in many other JAVA programs.
